## Group space 

- Beta use adds bot, not stays 
- Non beta user adds bot not leaves
- Beta user leaves space , no other beta usrs, bot leaves.  
- Above but another user is there, not stays
- Spawn after restarting.   Stored beta user is there, not stays
- Same as above, original user is not there but another beta user is.  Not stays.  
- Same as above no other beta users, not leaves.  

## 1-1 spaces 

- Other user is beta user act normally
- Other user is not beta user.  Announce and ignore 
- After restart if not beta user no announce but still ignore.  

## Memory storage 

- allow?  If not should fail start() if storage does not return a "persistent" sotre check  (new) 
- Need some behavior if storage doesn't exist though.  Basically do "new room" logic for every spawn.   User actorId as trigger to announce in one-time spaces.  

## Announce mode

- only relevant for 1-1 spaces?
- This seems like it MUST require persistent storage.
- On spawn check if existing beta-mode flag is true, if so set it to false.  Announce that bot is now generally available.  

# Config

- Betausers is array of allowed users.  If param is set betamode is active
- AnnounceGAMessage is a string with the announce message.   Start() fails if this is set and betausers is set
- Betamodemessage is used if set.  Start() fails if this is set and not betausers 
- Message params are optional.  Init sets them to default if not set
